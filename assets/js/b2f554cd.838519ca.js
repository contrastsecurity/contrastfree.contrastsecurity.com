With Contrast, we leverage this connection by using the same [Java instrumentation APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.instrument/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html) that are available in all Java, Scala, and Kotlin runtimes. This core part of the Kotlin runtime provided the foundation as we worked on the Kotlin APIs, semantics, and other ways that Kotlin applications differ from Java applications.\\n\\nWhen using the Kotlin agent, developers get the benefit of locations vulnerable dependencies (software composition analysis and SBOM) as well as the ability to locate custom code vulnerabilities in their own applications. The Kotlin agent can be downloaded from the Contrast Server or Maven Central. One single agent handles Kotlin, Java, and Scala together - the agent will detect and engage the appropriate language without any need for configuration or changes.\\n\\n## Want an Engineering Partnership?\\n\\nWe are still looking for feedback from Kotlin and Scala developers who are moving quickly with their applications. Development partnerships can be in any industry. If you are using Spring or Http4k or other Java frameworks, you can still participate.\\n\\nIf you are not yet a Contrast customer, please contact us to discuss participation. If you are an existing Contrast customer, please ask your support or customer success representative for access."},{"id":"SafeLog4j","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/SafeLog4j","editUrl":"https://github.com/contrastsecurity/contrastfree.contrastsecurity.com/blob/master/blog/blog/2021-12-17.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-17.md","title":"SafeLog4j","description":"We\'ve recently released SafeLog4j to help teams deal with the recent Log4j issue.","date":"2021-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 17, 2021","tags":[{"label":"java","permalink":"/blog/tags/java"}],"readingTime":1.835,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Costlow","title":"DevRel","imageURL":"https://github.com/erikcostlow.png","key":"costlow"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"SafeLog4j","title":"SafeLog4j","authors":["costlow"],"tags":["java"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Securing Server-Side Kotlin","permalink":"/blog/Kotlin Agent"},"nextItem":{"title":"Finding Log4j2 Vulnerabilities","permalink":"/blog/Finding Log4j2"}},"content":"We\'ve recently released [SafeLog4j](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/safelog4j) to help teams deal with the recent Log4j issue.\\n\\nThe tool is designed to help teams deal with the emergency and obtain time to patch applications and update to the secure version of log4j (currently 2.17.0 at time of writing). SafeLog4j uses an instrumentation-based approach similar to Contrast Assess and Protect but for a single purpose. SafeLog4j is available under an Apache 2 license and can be used by anyone, without an obligation to buy anything or even fill anything out.\\n\\n## Why SafeLog4j is necessary\\n\\nMany teams dealing with software are unable to locate which applications use log4j, and then to deal with them:\\n\\n * log4j could be buried in a fat jar, war, or ear\\n * log4j could be shaded in another jar\\n * log4j could be included in the appserver, not the code repo\\n * log4j could be part of dynamically loaded code or plugin\\n * log4j could be many different versions with different classloaders in a single app\\n * log4j could be masked by use of slf4j or other layers\\n * log4j could be renamed, recompiled, or otherwise changed\\n\\nMany approaches about finding log4j applications over the network are insufficient because they perform HTTP requests, which ignore the fact that many applications that use log4j are not web applications.\\n\\n## How SafeLog4j works\\n\\nThe common response to the Log4Shell vulnerability was puzzled curiousity about why Log4j was executing any code at all, when its job is simply to write data to a log or file. SafeLog4J simply disables the [JNDI processing](../learn/guides/learn-devsec/development/java/jndi.md) engine that was used to load the remote code. Other logging activities proceed as normal. Security teams can still detect attacks because attack payloads are logged as plain text and not executed.\\n\\n## Respect to the AWS Corretto Team\\n\\nI would like to extend respect to the AWS Corretto team, who used a [similar patching approach](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2). When AWS performed their [rapid response work](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j/), they used an instrumentation-based approach to the issue. Although they own a WAF, network-based defenses are the incorrect tier for this type of issue.\\n\\nLog4Shell is the first major vulnerability I\'m aware of where instrumentation was used as the primary defense, and that\'s really cool."},{"id":"Finding Log4j2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Finding Log4j2","editUrl":"https://github.com/contrastsecurity/contrastfree.contrastsecurity.com/blob/master/blog/blog/2021-12-14/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-12-14/index.md","title":"Finding Log4j2 Vulnerabilities","description":"The recent log4j vulnerability provides an opportunity to demonstrate the Contrast API for two reasons:","date":"2021-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 14, 2021","tags":[{"label":"java","permalink":"/blog/tags/java"},{"label":"log4j2","permalink":"/blog/tags/log-4-j-2"},{"label":"api","permalink":"/blog/tags/api"}],"readingTime":1.655,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Prashant Mishra","title":"Customer Success","key":"mishra"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Finding Log4j2","title":"Finding Log4j2 Vulnerabilities","authors":["mishra"],"tags":["java","log4j2","api"]},"prevItem":{"title":"SafeLog4j","permalink":"/blog/SafeLog4j"},"nextItem":{"title":"Scaling to Scala","permalink":"/blog/Scala Support - Dec 2021"}},"content":"The recent log4j vulnerability provides an opportunity to demonstrate the Contrast API for two reasons:\\n\\n 1.

We\'re excited to partner with many engineering organizations as we work to support Scala 2.12, Play, Akka, and more.\\n\\nThe ability to detect security vulnerabilities works similar to the way that Scala integrates with the underlying Java Platform itself. Scala developers can add the agent to their Scala applications and let the automated tool run to detect security flaws as the application is used. Scala developers can remain focused on their own application and code: they do not need to become or consult with security experts.\\n\\nIn light of the [recent log4j2 vulnerability](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/0-day-detection-of-log4j2-vulnerability), Scala applications run on the Java Virtual Machine and run Java libraries. Many Scala applications may also be impacted by the recent log4j2 vulnerability. With the Contrast agent, you can identify if this affects your Scala applications and do something about it.\\n\\nThe agent [integrates into Scala applications](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/en/scala.html) using the [Java instrumentation APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.instrument/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html) to monitor an application and understand what the JVM is doing and how Scala code is connecting the overall code flow. This level of monitoring enables developers to locate vulnerabilities like File Manipulation, Command Injection, Insecure Deserialization, and other flaws. The custom Scala handling provides different levels of API visibility that focus on the ways that Scala differs from core Java, adding support for the unique features that Scala brings to the table. Additional security detection is available for developers using common Scala libraries, including Play (for web applications) and Akka (for microservice interconnections). Developers working in Akka can see a custom [Flow Map](/docs/getting-started/security-teams/threat-modeling/) that represents the code flow between where data comes from, what it accesses, how the service connects with other scala services -- Flow Maps bring the security perspective into the overall architectural view.\\n\\n## How can I partner with Contrast on Scala\\n\\nWe are looking for feedback from Scala developers who are moving quickly with their applications.
